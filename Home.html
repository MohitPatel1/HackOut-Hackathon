                <h4 class="content">
                    The main issue in helping the poor is not the willingness to
                    donate but the lack of time and extra effort. And issue related 
                    to peoples don't go at slum aera. many people want to share left 
                    over food in poverty peoples and many people want to share their 
                    over used clothes and their childern's toys and any non useable  
                    items which usefull for poor peoples and some time in functions 
                    left over food go in to vain so theri want to share their food in 
                    slam area. so we try to easy way to share needed closths, foods, money, etc.. 
                    for poor peoples.
                    Mainly our try to transparent to proccess of NGOs work in help of poverty peoples, 
                    and our doneted items reach in proper hands or not. beacause most of the people are 
                    doubtfull. So our solutions is try to all details know people who doneted their items, money etc..
                    solution
                    first of all via website doner persons login in website by their phone number and if their donate cloths, 
                    they take the pic of that items and share in website, after that nearest intrested 
                    NGOs send their request, after that doner person if intrest and trust any NGO and 
                    know about their past works, it's acctualy trusted after that doner person allow any 
                    one NGO and that NGO send their volunteer to peakup doneted items
                    on his/her house and after that when NGOs arrange event of go to in slam area to help and distribute to the poor people    
                    and NGO return send the pic of doner's item that which acctualy give to poor peoples. by this way to we increase peoples 
                    trust on NGO and we help to in such a way who is poor.
